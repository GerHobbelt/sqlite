Autosetup API Reference
========================================================================

The Autosetup API is quite extensive and can be read either in
the [files in the `autosetup` dir](/dir/autosetup) or using:

>
```
$ ./configure --reference | less
```

That will include any docs from any TCL files in the `./autosetup` dir
which contain certain (simple) markup defined by autosetup.

This project's own autosetup-related APIs are in [proj.tcl][] or
[auto.def][].  The former contains helper APIs which are, more or
less, portable across projects (that file is re-used as-is in other
projects) and all have a `proj-` name prefix. The latter is the main
configure script driver and contains related functions which are
specific to this tree.

Autosetup API Tips
========================================================================

This section briefly covers only APIs which are frequently useful in
day-to-day maintenance and might not be immediately recognized as such
obvious from a casual perusal of `auto.def`. Their complete docs can be
found in [proj.tcl][].

In (mostly) alphabetical order:

- **`get-env VAR ?default?`**\  
  Will fetch an "environment variable"
  from the first of either: (A) a KEY=VALUE passed to the configure
  script or (B) the system's environment variables. Not to be confused
  with `getenv`, which only does the latter and is rarely, if ever,
  useful in this tree.
  - **`proj-get-env VAR ?default?`**\  
    Works like `get-env` but will, if that function finds no match,
    look for a file named `./.env-$VAR` and, if found, return its
    trimmed contents. This can be used, e.g., to set a developer's
    local preferences for the default `CFLAGS`.

- **`proj-define-if-opt-truthy flag defineName checkingMsg ?yesVal=1? ?noVal=0?`**\  
  Defines `defineName` to either `yesVal` or `noVal`, depending on
  whether `--flag` is truthy or not.

- **`proj-if-opt-truthy flag thenScript ?elseScript?`**\  
  Evals `thenScript` if the given `--flag` is truthy, else it
  evals the optional `elseScript`.

- **`proj-indented-notice ?-error? msg`**\  
  Breaks its `msg` argument into lines, trims them, and emits them
  with consistent indentation. If the `-error` flag is used, it then
  exits with non-0. This will stick out starkly from normal output
  and is intended to be used only for important notices.

- **`proj-opt-truthy flag`**\  
  Returns 1 if `--flag`'s value is "truthy," i.e. one of (1, on,
  enabled, yes).

- **`proj-opt-was-provided FLAG`**\  
  Returns 1 if `--FLAG` was explicitly provided to configure,
  else 0. This distinction can be used to determine, e.g., whether
  `--with-readline` was provided or whether we're searching for
  readline by default. In the former case, failure to find it should
  be treated as fatal.

- **`proj-val-truthy value`**\  
  Returns 1 if `$value` is "truthy," i.e. one of (1, on, enabled,
  yes).

- **`sqlite-add-feature-flag ?-shell? FLAG...`**\  
  Adds the given feature flag to the CFLAGS which are specific to building
  the library. It's intended to be passed one or more `-DSQLITE_ENABLE_...`,
  or similar, flags. If the `-shell` flag is used then it also passes
  its arguments to `sqlite-add-shell-opt`. This is a no-op if `FLAG`
  is not provided or is empty.

- **`sqlite-add-shell-opt FLAG...`**\  
  The shell-specific counterpart of `sqlite-add-feature-flag`.

Ensuring TCL Compatibility
========================================================================

It is important that any TCL files used by the configure process
remain compatible with both [JimTCL][] and the canonical TCL. Though
JimTCL has outstanding compatibility with canonical TCL, it does have
a few corners with incompatibilities, e.g. regular expressions. If a
script runs in JimTCL without using any JimTCL-specific features, then
it's a certainty that it will run in canonical TCL as well. The
opposite, however, is not _always_ the case.

By default, the configure script will search for an available `tclsh`
(under several common names, e.g. `tclsh8.6`) before falling back to
compiling the copy of `jimsh0.c` included in the source tree.

There are two simple ways to ensure that the configure process uses
JimTCL instead of the canonical `tclsh`, and either approach provides
equally high assurances about configure script compatibility across
TCL implementations:

1. Build on a system with no `tclsh` installed. In that case, the
   configure process will fall back to building the in-tree copy of
   JimTCL.

2. Manually build `./jimsh0` in the top of the checkout with:\  
   `cc -o jimsh0 autosetup/jimsh0.c`\  
   With that in place, the configure script will prefer to use that
   before looking for a system-level `tclsh`. Note that `make distclean`
   will remove that file.

**Note that `jimsh0` is distinctly different** from the `jimsh` which
gets built for code-generation purposes. The latter requires
non-default build flags to enable features which are
platform-dependent, most notably to make its `[file normalize]`
work. This means, for example, that the configure script and its
utility APIs must not use `[file normalize]`, but autosetup provides a
TCL implementation of `[file-normalize]` (note the dash) for portable
use in the configure script.


<a name="conventions"></a>
Design Conventions
========================================================================

This section describes the motivations for the most glaring of the
build's design decisions, in particular how they deviate from
historical, or even widely-conventional, practices.

Do Not Update Global Shared State
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In both the legacy Autotools-driven build and in common Autosetup
usage, feature tests performed by the configure script may ammend
values to global flags such as `CFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS`, and `LIBS`.
That's appropriate for a makefile which builds a single deliverable,
but less so for makefiles which produce multiple deliverables, as it's
unlikely that every single deliverable will require the same core set
of those flags.  In addition, that approach can make it difficult to
determine the origin of any given change to those flags because those
changes are hidden behind voodoo performed outside the immediate
visibility of the configure script's maintainer. It can also force the
maintainers of the configure script to place tests in a specific order
so that the resulting flags get applied at the correct time.

> A real-life example of the latter point: before the approach
  described below was taken to collecting build-time flags, the test
  for `-rflag` had to come _after_ the test for zlib because the
  results of the `-rflag` test implicitly modified the `CFLAGS`,
  breaking the zlib feature test. Because the feature tests no longer
  (intentionally) modify global state, that is not an issue.

Cases where feature tests modify global state in such a way that it
may impact later feature tests are either (A) very intentionally
defined to do so (e.g. the `--with-wasi-sdk` flag needs to modify the
build tool chain) or (B) are oversights (i.e. bugs).

This tree's configure script, utility APIs,
[`Makefile.in`](/file/Makefile.in), and [`main.mk`](/file/main.mk)
therefore strive to separate the results of any given feature test
into its own well-defined variables. For example:

- The linker flags for zlib are exported from the configure script as
  `LDFLAGS_ZLIB`, which `Makefile.in` and `main.mk` then expose as
  `LDFLAGS.zlib`.
- `CFLAGS_READLINE` (a.k.a. `CFLAGS.readline`) contains the `CFLAGS`
  needed for including `libreadline`, `libedit`, or `linenoise`, and
  `LDFLAGS_READLINE` (a.k.a. `LDFLAGS.readline`) is its link-time
  counterpart.

It is then up to the Makefile to apply and order the flags however is
appropriate.

> Sidebar: the `X_Y` convention is used used on the configure-script
  side because that process exports those flags as C `#define`s to
  `sqlite_cfg.h`, where dots are not permitted.  The `X.y` convention
  is used in the Makefile side primarily because the person who did
  the initial port finds that easier on the eyes and fingers.

At the end of the configure script, the global `CFLAGS` _ideally_
holds only flags which are either relevant to all targets or, failing
that, will have no unintended side-effects on any targets. That said:
clients frequently pass custom `CFLAGS` to `./configure` or `make` to
set library-level feature toggles, e.g. `-DSQLITE_OMIT_FOO`, in which
case there is no practical way to avoid "polluting" the builds of
arbitrary makefile targets with those. _C'est la vie._


<a name="updating"></a>
Updating Autosetup
========================================================================

Updating autosetup is, more often than not, painless. It requires having
a checked-out copy of [the autosetup git repository][autosetup-git]:

>
```
$ git clone https://github.com/msteveb/autosetup
$ cd autosetup
# Or, if it's already checked out:
$ git pull
```

Then, from the top-most directory of an SQLite checkout:

>
```
$ /path/to/autosetup-checkout/autosetup --install .
$ fossil status # show the modified files
```

Unless the upgrade made any incompatible changes (which is exceedingly
rare), that's all there is to it. Check over the diff, test the
configure process, and check it in.
